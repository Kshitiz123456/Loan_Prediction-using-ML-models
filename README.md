# Loan_Prediction-using-ML-models
Welcome to the Loan Approval Prediction project!
In this project, we have developed a machine learning model that assesses the likelihood of an individual's loan approval.
By training our model on a diverse dataset containing information about various individuals with different financial statuses
and their historical loan repayment behavior, we have enabled it to discern patterns that influence loan approval decisions.
