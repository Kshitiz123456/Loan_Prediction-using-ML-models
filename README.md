# Loan_Prediction-using-ML-models
Welcome to the Loan Approval Prediction project!
In this project, we have developed a machine learning model that assesses the likelihood of an individual's loan approval.
By training our model on a diverse dataset containing information about various individuals with different financial statuses
and their historical loan repayment behavior, we have enabled it to discern patterns that influence loan approval decisions.

# Data
Dream Housing Finance is a prominent player in the home loan sector, catering to urban, semi-urban, and rural areas alike. When customers express interest in a home loan, the company embarks on a pivotal step: assessing the customer's eligibility for the loan. This assessment is crucial to ensure that loans are provided to applicants who meet the necessary criteria.

In a bid to streamline and expedite this process, the company envisions an automated solution. This solution would utilize customer-provided details from online application forms to instantly determine their eligibility for a home loan. The parameters considered include Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History, and more. By leveraging this approach, Dream Housing Finance aims to efficiently categorize customers into segments based on their eligibility. This segmentation not only facilitates precise customer targeting but also enhances the efficiency of the loan approval process.
